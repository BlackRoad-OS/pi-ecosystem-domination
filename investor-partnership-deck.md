- **Access inequality:** $3,000 NVIDIA boxes exclude 99% of world
- **Power consumption:** 500W per device = environmental disaster

### Market Size
- **Global AI market:** $190B (2025)
- **Edge AI segment:** $50B (2025, growing 25% CAGR)
- **Raspberry Pi sales:** 60M+ units (proven distribution)
- **Developer audience:** 28M+ globally

### The Incumbent Response
NVIDIA announced Project DIGITS at CES 2025:
- **Price:** $3,000
- **Availability:** May 2025
- **Target:** High-end developers only
- **Lock-in:** NVIDIA ecosystem only

**The market is ripe for disruption.**

## 📊 SLIDE 10: RISK MITIGATION

### Key Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1: NVIDIA Lowers Price**
- **Mitigation:** We own the "sovereignty" narrative, not just cost
- **Backup:** Focus on offline-first, privacy, vendor independence
- **Reality:** NVIDIA won't compete on price (margin pressure)

**Risk 2: Cloud Providers Offer Free Tiers**
- **Mitigation:** One-time $75 still beats "free tier with limits"
- **Backup:** Hybrid cloud-edge solutions, not pure edge
- **Reality:** Free tiers are loss leaders, always have limitations

**Risk 3: Raspberry Pi Hardware Shortage**
- **Mitigation:** Support multiple SBCs (Orange Pi, Rock Pi, etc.)
- **Backup:** Custom hardware manufacturing (Year 2+)
- **Reality:** Pi production is stabilizing, 60M units proves scale

**Risk 4: Technological Obsolescence**
- **Mitigation:** Model-agnostic platform (Phi-3 → Llama → GPT-4 Mini)
- **Backup:** Hardware-agnostic (Pi 5 → Pi 6 → custom boards)
- **Reality:** Edge AI will only grow, not shrink

**Risk 5: Regulatory/Legal Challenges**
- **Mitigation:** All open-source models (MIT licensed), no API TOS violations
- **Backup:** Legal fund from seed round, industry partnerships
- **Reality:** We enable sovereignty, regulators will support this

## 📊 SLIDE 11: EXIT SCENARIOS

### Strategic Acquisition (Most Likely)

**Potential Acquirers:**
1. **NVIDIA** - Defensive acquisition, own the low-end market
2. **Raspberry Pi Ltd** - Vertical integration, software + hardware
3. **Cloud Providers** - AWS/Google/Azure add edge AI solutions
4. **Enterprise Software** - Salesforce/ServiceNow add AI capabilities

**Valuation Multiples:**
- **Current SaaS:** 10-15× ARR for growth companies
- **Edge AI Premium:** +50% (hot sector, defensible)
- **At $30M ARR:** $450M - $675M valuation (15× multiple)
- **At $90M ARR:** $1.35B - $2B valuation (15× multiple)

**Timeline:** 3-5 years from seed

### IPO (Ambitious but Possible)

**Requirements:**
- $100M+ ARR
- 40%+ growth rate
- Clear path to profitability
- Differentiated position

**Timeline:** 5-7 years from seed
**Valuation:** $2B+ (public market premium)

### Recapitalization (Alternative)

**Scenario:** Profitable at scale, dividend-paying
**Timeline:** Year 5+
**Return:** Ongoing dividends vs one-time exit

## 📊 SLIDE 12: WHY NOW?

### Perfect Storm of Opportunities

**1. NVIDIA's Timing**
- Announced Jan 2025, shipping May 2025
- We're 4 months ahead with proof, not vaporware
- Window to establish market before incumbents respond

**2. AI Democratization Wave**
- GPT-4, Claude, Llama proved AI demand is real
- But cost/access still prohibitive for 99% of world
- Timing: "AI is hot" + "costs are too high" = perfect positioning

**3. Raspberry Pi at Scale**
- 60M units sold (proven distribution)
- Pi 5 with 8GB RAM (AI-capable hardware)
- Ecosystem maturity (software, community, accessories)

**4. Digital Sovereignty Movement**
- GDPR, data localization, privacy regulations increasing
- Enterprises want control, not cloud dependency
- Perfect narrative for our value prop

**5. Edge AI Market Inflection**
- $50B market growing 25% CAGR
- No clear leader yet (fragmented market)
- First-mover advantage still available

**This exact opportunity won't exist in 6 months. NVIDIA ships in May. We need to scale NOW.**
