## 📧 CFP (CALL FOR PROPOSALS) TEMPLATES

### Template 1: Technical Deep-Dive

**Title:** "Building Production AI on $75 Raspberry Pi: A Technical Deep-Dive"

**Abstract (250 words):**
```
While NVIDIA announced a $3,000 "personal AI supercomputer" at CES 2025, 2,847
people across 67 countries are already running production AI workloads on $75
Raspberry Pi devices. This talk presents the technical architecture, real-world
benchmarks, and deployment strategies that make edge AI accessible to everyone.

We'll cover:
• Architecture: How Ollama + Phi-3 Mini achieves 2-second inference on ARM64
• Optimization: Memory management, model quantization, and performance tuning
• Networking: Mesh architectures for distributed inference across Pi clusters
• Production: Real deployments serving 50K patients (Nigeria), 10K students (India)
• Benchmarks: Side-by-side comparison vs cloud APIs and NVIDIA hardware

Attendees will learn:
• How to deploy LLMs on resource-constrained devices
• Cost optimization strategies (97% reduction vs cloud)
• Real-world edge AI architecture patterns
• When to choose edge vs cloud for AI workloads

This is not theoretical - we have 2,847 production nodes and $8.2M in proven
savings. The talk includes live demos, open-source code, and a free starter kit
for attendees to build their own $75 AI system.

Perfect for: DevOps engineers, ML engineers, technical architects, and anyone
interested in cost-effective, sovereign AI infrastructure.
```

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Deploy production LLMs on Raspberry Pi in 30 minutes
- Understand edge vs cloud trade-offs for AI workloads
- Calculate ROI for edge AI deployments
- Access open-source starter kit and community

### Template 2: Business/Strategy Focus

**Title:** "How We Saved $8.2M Running AI on Raspberry Pi Instead of the Cloud"

**Abstract (250 words):**
```
Cloud AI costs are spiraling out of control. OpenAI APIs cost $8K/month for
typical startups. AWS AI services can exceed $150K/year. And now NVIDIA wants
$3,000 upfront for local AI - shipping in May 2025.

Meanwhile, our network of 2,847 Raspberry Pi nodes has collectively saved
$8.2 million running the exact same workloads for $75 per node. This talk
presents the business case, ROI calculations, and strategic implications of
edge AI vs cloud AI.

Case Studies:
• Japanese startup: Saved $150K/year, extended runway 18 months, reached
profitability
• Indian education nonprofit: AI tutors for 10,000 students at $0.75/student/year
• Nigerian hospital: Serving 50,000 patients on $900 infrastructure vs $36K/year
cloud costs

We'll cover:
• Total Cost of Ownership: 5-year comparison (cloud vs edge vs hybrid)
• When edge AI makes sense (and when it doesn't)
• Digital sovereignty: Why owning your AI infrastructure matters
• Market opportunity: $50B edge AI market growing 25% CAGR

Attendees will learn how to:
• Calculate true AI infrastructure costs
• Build business cases for edge AI deployments
• Identify use cases perfect for edge vs cloud
• Escape vendor lock-in while maintaining capabilities

This isn't anti-cloud - it's about choosing the right architecture for your
specific needs and budget.
```

**Audience:** CTOs, VPs Engineering, startup founders, technical decision-makers

### Template 3: Social Impact Focus

**Title:** "Digital Sovereignty Through Edge AI: Democratizing Access to Intelligence"

**Abstract (250 words):**
```
AI is changing the world - but who gets access? When NVIDIA's "affordable" AI
solution costs $3,000 and cloud APIs charge per-token, we're creating a new
digital divide. This talk explores how edge AI on commodity hardware is
democratizing access to artificial intelligence globally.

Real Impact Stories:
• Dr. Amara in Lagos: Using $900 in Raspberry Pis to provide AI-assisted
diagnosis to 50,000 patients with unreliable internet
• Priya in Mumbai: Running AI tutors for 10,000 students across 50 rural
schools with offline-first architecture
• Kenji in Tokyo: Bootstrapped startup that saved $150K/year, giving them 18
months extra runway to reach profitability

The Digital Sovereignty Argument:
• Own your hardware, own your data, own your future
• No API rate limits, no service outages, no vendor lock-in
• Privacy by default (data never leaves your device)
• Accessible globally (works offline, low power, affordable)

We'll discuss:
• Why digital sovereignty matters in the AI age
• How to build AI systems that work anywhere (including poor connectivity)
• The economics of equity (making AI accessible to all)
• Policy implications (should AI be a utility or a luxury?)

This is more than cost optimization - it's about ensuring everyone has access
to the most transformative technology of our generation. 2,847 nodes across 67
countries are proving it's possible.
```

**Audience:** Social impact, nonprofit, policy, education sectors
